  ## Create Secure Passwords & Passphrases
  
</div>

PrivacySafe Bot is a privacy-focused, secure password and passphrase generator designed to help you create strong, memorable secrets. All data generation is done **entirely on your device**, using a cryptographically strong random number generator. No data is copied, transmitted, or stored on any server, ensuring your secrets remain private.

Visit the website at [https://privacysafe.bot](https://privacysafe.bot) to start generating your secure passwords and passphrases.

## Features

- **Customizable Password Generation:** Choose from lengths of 8 to 48 characters, including lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Memorable Passphrases:** Generate passphrases consisting of 3 to 8 words, with customizable delimiters like hyphens, spaces, and numbers.
- **Client-Side Security:** All passwords and passphrases are generated locally on your device using [Mozilla’s Web Cryptography API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues), ensuring zero transmission of data to any server.
- **No Data Storage:** No passwords or passphrases are stored or transmitted; everything stays private and secure.
